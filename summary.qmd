## Python vs R in Data Science: A Case for Bilingual Data Scientist

This book will also contain resources that will be  helpful in making others learn programming. It will be straight to point and avoid jargons as much as possible. I begin with a long time controversy about the best language to use as a data scientist, Python or R. I have used both and I will attempt to highlight the strengths and unavoidably the weaknesses each language possess.
