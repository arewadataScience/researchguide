## Advice to New Researchers

There are as many paths to research as there are researchers. Every researcher has what worked and what did not work for him/her. However, the following are a few generic advice that works for all:

1.  Practice writing skills and make sure you learn to enjoy research

2.  Be curious and explore how things work. This will help in making your research more grounded.

3.  Participate in scientific discussions with peers as this can unlock new insights you never saw on your own.

4.  Perseverance in times of difficulty as with research, inevitably there will be times where one will feel like quitting due to the challenges that come up.

5.  Look for mentors to guide and ease your research journey

6.  Develop presentation skills.

7.  Work on your happiness and mental health. Your personal well being is most important. Understand this.
